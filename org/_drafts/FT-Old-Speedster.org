After several, more or less successful, attempts of building FT planes
I decided to get my hands on [[http://flitetest.com/articles/ft-old-speedster-build][FT Old Speedster]]. I wanted a really slow
flyer because all the space I can find outside my window is a not so
large [[http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map%3D16/52.2129/21.0114][football field]] and a few smaller lawns. Warsaw is a nice green
city where most green are leavs on trees. Flying slow means flying low
too which reduces all kinds of risks of lying in a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_zone][CTR]] of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin][Frédéric
Chopin]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Chopin_Airport][airport]].

After using [[http://www.display.3acomposites.com/en/produkty/foam-x/cechy.html][FOAM-X]] for FT Flyer and finding out it is way to heavy for
that design (although I really like it for its rigidity), and learning
that [[http://www.depronfoam.com/index.html][Depron]] works great for FT Nutball (although it's a bit too
expensive to be cheap) I decided to try out something new. I found 5
mm thick [[http://www.cezar.eu/?str%3D4&n%3D19&p%3D129][Cezar Expert Mat]]. At about 1.20 €/m² I consider it cheap
compared to almost 5 €/m² for Depron at my local hobby shop and they
both are just [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene#Extruded_polystyrene_foam][XPS]]. There are some differences, however, Cezar XPS is
between half and one millimetre thinner, it's not as flat as Depron, a
bit more brittle and it's blue what makes paints look a bit different.
It also melts in lower temperature and you need to be careful with hot
glue, put some on one piece, wait a few seconds and maybe spread the
glue with a popsicle stick before attaching to pieces together.

Building a plane is rather straightforward if you watched the build
video. The only difference is due to lack of paper which holds hinges
and A/B folds together, nothing your favourite sticky tape along the
cuts can't fix. I chose to laser cut the foam and can say it works
fine (although it was not cheap, but I was in a hurry). If you choose
to paint your aircraft instead of using decals I recommend doing it
brefore you glue it together. Since there is no paper you don't have
to use Minwax (any European cheap alternative?) but you nead to avoid
nitro-based paints. I still had some grean and orange [[http://chemmot.com.pl/products_en/decoration.html][Deco Color]] paint
I had used before and it works fine with XPS.
