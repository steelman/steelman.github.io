A while back a friend of mine encouraged me to obtain an RC plane. He
recommended me [[http://cyber-fly.pl/pl/p/PIPER-J3-EPP-Model-dla-poczatkujacych-pilotow/795][Piper J3 EPP]] available at [[http://cyber-fly.pl][Cyber Fly]]. After we met I did
some research to learn about servos, motors, ESCs, radios and all the
stuff that has changed since I was a little boy dreaming about flying
a plane on the playground. A lot has has changed! Back then most
electric motors had a hard time pulling themselves off the ground not
to mention cells and a plane. Most polymer materials weren't there at
least not as readily available cheap products. And last but not least
the analog radios operated at ~30MHz which meant huge (~1.25m)
antennae, not quite easy to handle for a fellow not much higher than
that.

In my research I spotted [[http://mikeysrc.com/][Mikey's RC]] [[http://www.youtube.com/user/MikeysRC][videos]]. I was really impressed by
his [[http://youtu.be/6VV37t1CwX4][Pylon Racer]] but it was the [[http://mikeysrc.com/Sport-Trainer.html][Sport Trainer]] that made me think: hey
this is so easy, I must have this one! I can have it! I like this
feeling. I've always been a bit mechanically challenged and prefered
clicking a keyboard rather than tinkering with physical objects. Now I
feel ready to try [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DIDtepG8EvHE][something completely different]].

I've got Mikey's plans (that was easy) and two 1000x700x5 mm sheets of
FOAM-X foamboard (pol. płyta piankowa) 16 zł (4 €) each at [[http://allegro.pl/sklep/25020155_pracownia-scenografa][Pracownia
Scenografa]]. Here's the first catch, the wings are 40" which is 16 mm
longer then the sheet. I can't wait to find what's next.
