My wallet got significantly lighter today, although I tried hard to
get as much as possible. For the last several weeks I've been writing
[[https://gist.github.com/steelman/10193501/ffb49a0032c8c19b5586eb870d5ac941280902bd][this scirpt]] (don't follow the link, it is still a very scruffy
version) to optimise my expenses. The script takes a BOM and a list of
products available in shops and tries to find a subset of products
that provides all materials needed (BOM) *and* is the cheapest
including shipping. The first version I conceived was O(2^n) CPU-wise,
where n is the number products. With n around 40 this problem becomes
practically unsolvable (at least in Python).

The second approch was made possible by a teammate of mine who gave me
a dynamic programming algorithm that flips the problem and makes it
O(p * 2^m), where p is the number of products and m number of BOM
entries (times the amount of materials, e.g. ten servos of the same
kind increase m by 10 unless you declare that shops provide them in
10-packs). The first version of this alogrithm didn't count shipping
(which may significantly change the solution, I saw it after my
running my binary tree traversal algorithm for about twenty four
hours). Unfortunately adding vendor-dependent shipping costs means (at
least now) iterating over all subsets of vendors (2^v). The script
finishis its job in about two hours and with some more work it could
run in parallel but it still can't be declared scalable. I am going to
build a few other things this year and hopefully I will find some time
to improve the script (we've alread got an idea of an algorithm being
quite fast though a lot more memory hungry).

This post was supposed to be about the plane(s) I am going to build
and not about the software I wirte. Let's what I am going to find in
my mailbox soon.

This isn't exactly what Mikey was promising ($10 RC plane). I suppose,
however, he's got sutff worth a lot more thant taht in his drawers.

[fn:1] I'll make a [[http://makezine.com/projects/make-38-cameras-and-av/rc-remote-drop-mechanism/][remote drop mechanism]] to release it after pulling
it up in the air.
