<p>
I have decided to buy a NAS quite some time ago. After several
attempts to make a decision: "which one", I finally bought <a href="http://www.zyxel.com/products_services/nsa325_v2.shtml">Zyxel's NSA
325 v2</a>. At a little bit less than 100 €, with its spec it seems like the
the best bang for the buck now.
</p>

<p>
"The bang" for me is primary ability to run software of my choice
instead of some crappy image created by a poor engineer trying to feed
the management beast. Although it seems *BSD support Marvel's Kirkwood
SoCs, and I do recognise *BSD as excellent server systems, I have
decided to go "safe" and took the path I know best, that is Linux. It
seems the mainline kernel has everything that is needed to use the
hardware at its full potential. If that is not enough, Philipp
Kirchhofer, added a few commits to the mainline v3.18, and <a href="https://github.com/pkirchhofer/nsa325-linux-upstream">published</a>
it on github. Philipp's code is based on v3.18.7, to be precise, but
it can be rebased without any conflicts to v3.18.9. So far so good.

Since I haven't developed anything for ARM on my desktop Gentoo PC, I
had to install the toolchain. As you may expect it wasn't as quick as
<code>apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi</code> but Gentoo's <code>crossdev -t
arm-linux-gnueabi -s1</code> isn't too difficult either. Next, some less
obvious stuff begins.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">export ARCH=arm

make nsa325_defconfig
make menuconfig          # iff you think you know what you're doing
make nsa325

<p>
Suddenly!

<pre class="example">
  Kernel: arch/arm/boot/zImage is ready

<p>
What a shame! I need to install dev-embedded/u-boot-tools to get
<code>mkimage(1)</code> to finally get a fresh and tasty kernel.

All right, I have to clean up my desk a bit to have any space to
disassemble the device to get to the serial console. No, today's not
the day.

To manipulate the firmware of the NSA 325 v2 I am going to need to
access its <a href="http://zyxel.nas-central.org/wiki/Serial_port_%2528NSA325%2529">serial console</a> (UART). It's not possible to attach it to an
RS232-to-USB converter directly because the port works on 3.3V TTL
levels (0 V - 3.3 V), while RS232 port requires much higher voltage
amplitude (-12 V - +12 V). I've got a converter based on MAX3232,
which in accepts V<sub>cc</sub> between 3 V and 5.5 V and outputs ±5.4 on the
RS-232 side. It works just fine with TP-Link's <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">TL-WR1043ND</a> (v1.x)
which also has 3.3 V TTL UART. This is a custom circuit so the
picture below is just for my reference. Tx/Rx on the TTL side are
named from the standpoint of the DTE attached to RS-232 side.
