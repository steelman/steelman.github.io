I have decided to buy a NAS quite some time ago. After several
attempts to make a decision: "which one", I finally bought <a href="http://www.zyxel.com/products_services/nsa325_v2.shtml">Zyxel's NSA
325 v2</a>. At a little bit less than 100 €, with its spec it seems like the
the best bang for the buck now.
</p>

<p>
"The bang" for me is primary ability to run software of my choice
instead of some crappy image created by a poor engineer trying to feed
the management beast. Although it seems *BSD support Marvel's Kirkwood
SoCs, and I do recognise *BSD as excellent server systems, I have
decided to go "safe" and took the path I know best, that is Linux. It
seems the mainline kernel has everything that is needed to use the
hardware at its full potential. If that is not enough, Philipp
Kirchhofer, added a few commits to the mainline v3.18, and <a href="https://github.com/pkirchhofer/nsa325-linux-upstream">published</a>
it on github. Philipp's code is based on v3.18.7, to be precise, but
it can be rebased without any conflicts to v3.18.9. So far so good.

Since I haven't developed anything for ARM on my desktop Gentoo PC, I
had to install the toolchain. As you may expect it wasn't as quick as
<code>apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi</code> but Gentoo's <code>crossdev -t
arm-linux-gnueabi -s1</code> isn't too difficult either. Next, some less
obvious stuff begins.

make menuconfig          # iff you think you know what you're doing
make nsa325

<p>
Suddenly!

<pre class="example">

<p>
What a shame! I need to install dev-embedded/u-boot-tools to get
<code>mkimage(1)</code> to finally get a fresh and tasty kernel.

All right, I have to clean up my desk a bit to have any space to
disassemble the device to get to the serial console. No, today's not

To manipulate the firmware of the NSA 325 v2 I am going to need to
access its <a href="http://zyxel.nas-central.org/wiki/Serial_port_%2528NSA325%2529">serial console</a> (UART). It's not possible to attach it to an
RS232-to-USB converter directly because the port works on 3.3V TTL
levels (0 V - 3.3 V), while RS232 port requires much higher voltage
amplitude (-12 V - +12 V). I've got a converter based on MAX3232,
which in accepts V<sub>cc</sub> between 3 V and 5.5 V and outputs ±5.4 on the
RS-232 side. It works just fine with TP-Link's <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">TL-WR1043ND</a> (v1.x)
which also has 3.3 V TTL UART. This is a custom circuit so the
picture below is just for my reference. Tx/Rx on the TTL side are
named from the standpoint of the DTE attached to RS-232 side.

Yesterday I disassembled the box (the photos coming as soon as I find
a convenient way to publish them here). The serial port is on the
"upper" edge of the board and a five pin plug. It also needs to be
bent 90° outwards of the PCB, otherwise the plug won't fit between the
PCB and the HDD frame.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I had my box assembled again, I sat down to build a basic
Debian rootfs. Fortunately this isn't hard and is actually quite well
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/EmDebian/CrossDebootstrap">documented</a>. I chose the QEMU method, which basicly boils down to
issuing three commands. Before you can run the third one, make sure
you have set up your <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/tree/Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt?id=bfa76d49576599a4b9f9b7a71f23d73d6dcff735">binfmt<sub>misc</sub></a> bindings correctly. Otherwise, you
won't be able to run ARM binaries on your PC which is actually
required to complete the installation of Debian packages.

</pre>

<p>
To make things more funny i decided to use <a href="http://www.ansible.com">Ansible</a> to manage the
configuration of my NAS starting with the playbook for building the
rootfs. I will publish it when it's ready.
