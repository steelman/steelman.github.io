Today I collected some tools and materials I ordered on Saturday. I've
got an A4 paper-trimmer for cutting margins of the templates. OK, the
templates are only an excuse, I always wanted to have one. The one I
got is: cheap (10 €) not too robust although it has some nice
features. Not only it cuts paper in two but it can also make traces
for folding, do "wavy" cuts and perforation. I also got a cutting mat
(6 €). I wanted a branded blue one but just before hitting "BUY" I
realised it has got inch based grid (no I won't write here: "oh, don't
get me wrong there is nothing bad in inches but&#x2026;", honestly I think
inches are weird and require lots of nasty Kowalsky's constants when
you do some physics). So I found this <a href="http://www.goldpol.eu/mata-ciecia-rozmiar-maty45cmx30cm-heyda-cena-zestaw-p-7451.html">one</a>, it is cheaper and bigger.
When I buy things on <a href="http://allegro.pl">Allegro</a> (eBay isn't very popular in Poland) I
always check what other items a vendor's got for sale. And next to the
mat there was a Velcro tape, 50 ¢ per two metres of tape (or one metre
of complementary tapes). That is <b>ten</b> times cheaper than a self
adhesive velcro in a hobby shop. Conclusion: if you want something
cheap go to a haberdasher.

Material-wise I got some pine slats and a sheet (210x410x1,5 mm) of
(birch?) plywood. I really wanted to try posicle sticks and they would
probably be cheaper per square unit. If only they were available.

In the evening I took the templates I've printed, cut them out and
stuck them together. To cut the foam I need to get a block of wood
from the carpenter and cut it at 45°. I am afraid I can't hold the
knife straight enough to cut wings the way Mikey recomments.
