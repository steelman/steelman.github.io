<p>
This sentence<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> seems to have vast and sometimes not well understood
consequences. I'll try to collecto some thoughts here.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is no such thing as law of economy. There are rules which are
not completely random and they work in <b>most</b> cases, and taht is
all. I've learnt about that at my economy classess so I assume this
is not a surprise for anyone who attended one too.
</li>

<li>People <b>can</b> change the rules. Although many rulse result from
others somewhat automatically, some still can be changed. For
example: it costs money to borrow money for a period of time. Some
may say it is impossible to forbid taking money for lending money.
They are wrong, at least those who, at the same time, agree with me
that it is good to punish for bribery.
</li>

<li>Physicists should not be allowed to work in banks. At least not
until they take and some social science courses to learn that they
are going to deal with people and not with falling apples.
</li>
</ol>
