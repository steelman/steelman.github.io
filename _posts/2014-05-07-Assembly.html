Mikey has posted great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCCBBF9DC86F8B2B2">videos</a> about building the Trainer. They are very
helpful and anyone who builds the plane for the first time, like I
did, should watch them. However, he takes a few shortcuts I didn't
take and I recommend not to take them. I already wrote about <a href="{% post_url 2014-04-07-Cut-out %}">cutting
out</a> the plane. In this post I would like to write about things I did
differently than Mikey.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Hinges</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
For me it was most convenient to make all the hinges right after
cutting the three main parts out (I was wrong though, read below).
</p>

<p>
I made some mistakes, I've got my ailerons without nice tappered
trailing edge but this probably won't hurt much. If it does, I can
try to stich nice trailing edges later. Hey, this is foam board,
right? I made hinges with 3M packing tape tape. I really can
recommendt it. It's the cheapest way of making hinges and the tape
sticks very well to the cardboard.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Painting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I painted the plane with orange (RAL 2004) and dark green (RAL 6005)
<a href="http://chemmot.com.pl/products_en/decoration.html">Deco Color</a> spray paints (4 € per 400 ml can). The orange paint is
quite light and leaves any marks made with black pen on the foam
bord visible. It definitely won't cover any other darker paint so
put it before. The green one on the other hand is quite dark and
thick. The paint sticks to the packing tape I used for hinges,
however it is very easy to remove it with.

</p>

<p>
Note 1: Try if your masking tape is coverd with a glue that is weak
enough not to tear holes in the cardbord covering your foambord.
</p>

<p>
Note 2: Paint the elements <b>before</b> cutting control surfaces and
making hinges. Especially if you are going to use packing tape.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Push rods</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
According to Mikeys recommendation I bough Φ 1,5 mm hardened steel
rod. It seems quite appropriate when I took it off the shelf in the
hobby shop. I changed my mind the moment I tried to bend it. On one
hand it is very flexible if you apply a force perpendicularly and
quite stiff if you want to push something with it. On the other
hand, it is <b>fucking</b> hard to bend and make a proper "Z" for control
horns. The moment the first "Z" was almost ready I split the rod
laterally to its length. I don't know how Mikey manages to make a
push rod from 0.055" "Piano wire". I managed to make two for
ailerons with a single bend on each end. I secured the ends with
some thread soked with CA glue. And I gave up.
</p>

<p>
For rudder and elevator I decided to buy Φ 1,2 mm and Φ 0,8 mm rods
and some Bowden tube. After testing both I decided to use the
thicker one and used up almost the whole metre I bought.
</p>

<p>
Note 1: Do not use music wire thicker 1,2 mm for push rods!
</p>

<p>
Note 2: I used <a href="http://cyber-fly.pl/pl/p/Dzwignia-steru-13%2C5-x-16-mm/3156">horns</a> that do not go through the foam. Before
attaching them to the control surfaces with CA I removed pieces of
cardbord to make the horns stick directly to the foam.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Fuselage reinforcement</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Although, I had got I bag of barbecue scewers to make some <a href="http://www.bigwindkites.com/20kids/20kidsmatlist.html">kites</a>, I
decided to reinforce the fuselage with a solid 5x5 pine slat all
along its lentght. As you will find in the next post it was I wise
choice. Hot glue was used as usual.
</p>

<p>
Note 1: You may want check the direction of the grain of a slat and
make it perpendicular to the fuselage. It should be even stiffer
then and harder to break (Am I wrong?)
</p>

<p>
Note 2: Watch out for popsicle sticks on the edge of the fuselage.
If you stick them so they meet below the bottom front corner of the
battery tray the fuselage may tend to break along the line between
the corner and the point wher the sticks meet. Put some barbecue
scewers there.

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Motor mount</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
I made the motor mount almost exactly the way Mikey has designed it
with two exceptions. As I worte before I couldn't find popsicle
sticks so I decided to use 1,5 mm thick plywood for firewall. My
uncle was so kind to cut it for me and drill holes. I attached the
motor to it with M3 screws with nuts and washers facing backwards. I
pushed the holes in the foamboard with the screws before putting the
glue on the plywood. It appeard that the fuselage slat was too long
and it blocked one of the screws so I cut a second foam square and
stuck it between the the original motor mount and the plywood. Looks
fine, works great.
