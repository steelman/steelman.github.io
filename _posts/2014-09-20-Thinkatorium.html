<p>
<a href="http://www.kopernik.org.pl/en/">Copernicus Science Centre in Warsaw</a> has always been a place open for
everyone who is interested in science and how it can be applied in
practice. There is a lot interactive exhibits for all ages (the
youngest visitors love the <a href="http://www.kopernik.org.pl/en/exhibitions/buzzz-gallery/">Buzzz!</a> gallery). A few months ago the
Centre hosted the <a href="http://makezine.com/2014/02/15/makerland-three-days-of-hardware-hacking-in-warsaw/">Makerland</a>, a conference for makers.
</p>

<p>
Last Thursday the Centre has opened <a href="http://www.kopernik.org.pl/en/exhibitions/thinkatorium/">Thinkatorium</a><sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, a place where
everyone can learn to hack simply by starting hacking. There are going
to be desks, tools and materials. "There is no deadline, no specific
instructions, and the solution is unknown." That's how it's been
advertised. I really wondered what does it mean so I decided to visit
the place today.
</p>

<p>
The room is on the first floor (the first above the ground floor) and
it is hard to miss it thanks to a clear sign above the door.

<p>Welcome to Thinkatorium</p>
</div>

<p>
Right behind the door there is a board with yellow pages. They contain
different tasks for visitors. There are topics of tasks, difficulty
level (lower right corner) and expected time required (lower left).
This means there isn't complete anarchy. Those who have never hacked
before may have problems answering two questions at the same time.
What to do? How to do it?

<p>"Wareshelf"</p>
</div>

<p>
I chose "The Tower" and got appropriately labelled toolbox from the "wareshelf".

<p>The toolbox</p>
</div>

<p>
In the toolbox there were: one pair of scissors, two staplers,
drinking straws, a quite heavy orange ball and a leaflet describing
the goal. The goal was to build a tower that would withstand the ball
put on its top for one minute.

<p>Work in progress</p>
</div>

<p>
The little fellow helped with with the stapler every time I said
"squeeze" and after a quarter the first tower was ready.

<p>Achievement</p>
</div>

<p>
The next attempt took us significantly longer. After no less than
twenty squeezes my assistant was a bit tired and I had to make the
final fixes myself.

<p>Take #2</p>
</div>

<p>
The other tasks I saw people working on were "Melting" and "Shadows"
There were also some pieces of pool-noodles stuck on barbecue skewers
flying in a vertical wind tunnel.

<p>Shadows</p>
</div>

<p>
Experienced hackers may find the tasks and toolboxes a bit limited
and/or limiting, however, this simplicity may help them introduce
others to tinkering as a way of solving everyday problems.
