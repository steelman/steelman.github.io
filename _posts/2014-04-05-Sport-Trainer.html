A while back a friend of mine encouraged me to obtain an RC plane. He
recommended me <a href="http://cyber-fly.pl/pl/p/PIPER-J3-EPP-Model-dla-poczatkujacych-pilotow/795">Piper J3 EPP</a> available at <a href="http://cyber-fly.pl">Cyber Fly</a>. After we met I did
some research to learn about servos, motors, ESCs, radios and all the
stuff that has changed since I was a little boy dreaming about flying
a plane on the playground. A lot has has changed! Back then most
electric motors had a hard time pulling themselves off the ground not
to mention cells and a plane. Most polymer materials weren't there at
least not as readily available cheap products. And last but not least
the analog radios operated at ~30MHz which meant huge (~1.25m)
antennae, not quite easy to handle for a fellow not much higher than
that.

In my research I spotted <a href="http://mikeysrc.com/">Mikey's RC</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MikeysRC">videos</a>. I was really impressed by
his <a href="http://youtu.be/6VV37t1CwX4">Pylon Racer</a> but it was the <a href="http://mikeysrc.com/Sport-Trainer.html">Sport Trainer</a> that made me think: hey
this is so easy, I must have this one! I can have it! I like this
feeling. I've always been a bit mechanically challenged and prefered
clicking a keyboard rather than tinkering with physical objects. Now I
feel ready to try <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDtepG8EvHE">something completely different</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've got Mikey's plans (that was easy) and two 1000x700x5 mm sheets of
FOAM-X foamboard (pol. płyta piankowa) 16 zł (4 €) each at <a href="http://allegro.pl/sklep/25020155_pracownia-scenografa">Pracownia
Scenografa</a>. Here's the first catch, the wings are 40" which is 16 mm
longer then the sheet. I can't wait to find what's next.
